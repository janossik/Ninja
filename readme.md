### Update!

I added a lot of my own approach making the code more up-to-date. Mainly only the game mechanics remained, but also added my game mechanics!

### update 1.0.1

- Full width game on the window browser
- Scaling game difficulty over time (if the game is longer, the robots will be faster, more robots and the decreasing distance between the robots)
