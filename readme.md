### This game was born from an idea in a book "Baw się kodem! Twoja własna gra. CoderDojo Nano" but now I have changed the code beyond recognition.

[You can look at the book I was learning from, but my game is different. If you want to know what the game looked like before, check out older commits or play it below.](https://helion.pl/ksiazki/baw-sie-kodem-twoja-wlasna-gra-coderdojo-nano-jurie-horneman-coderdojo,poprok.htm#format/d)
[Play old version!](https://ninjananonuc.netlify.app)

In this game you are a ninja and you have to fight all the time.
Good luck, shinobi!

## Control

- You can jump using the spaceBar and the up arrow
- If you want to speed up the run, press the right arrow, but remember the ninjas get tired too!

### Version 2.0.0

- Game code is now written in TypeScript.
- I changed the dimensions of the game so that it takes up the entire available window.
